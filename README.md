Overview
========
The Japanese Name Converter is a simple Android app that converts English names into their Japanese equivalents using a mix of dictionary lookup and machine learning. The machine learning algorithm is a variation of the Transformation-Based Learning (TBL) method invented by Eric Brill.  You can read [the explanatory article][2] for more info.

The project is made up of two components: 1) a Maven Java project for building the TBL transduction model (preprocessing phase), and 2) the Android app itself.
